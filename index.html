        <p>
          An <strong>anechoic chamber</strong> is a room specifically designed
          to prevent reflections or echoes of sound or electromagnetic waves,
          allowing only direct sound or signals to be perceived. This makes them
          ideal for situations where precise testing and measurement is
          essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "anechoic" was coined by American acoustician
          <strong>Leo Beranek</strong
          ><sup id="ref-1"><a href="#note-1" class="note-ref">1</a></sup
          >, originally referring to acoustic chambers, but is now also applied
          to chambers used for radio frequency (RF) and sonar testing.

          The size of an <strong>anechoic chamber</strong> can vary greatly,

          airplane hangars<sup id="ref-2"

        <h2>How Acoustic Anechoic Chambers Work</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Acoustic anechoic chambers</span> are used to test
          devices such as loudspeakers that produce intense sound levels. These
          chambers are critical because it would be impossible to test these
          sound levels outdoors in populated areas.
        </p>
        <h2>Common Testing Applications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Measuring the transfer function of a loudspeaker.</li>
          <li>
            Analyzing the directivity of noise emissions from industrial
            machinery.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Silence in an Anechoic Chamber</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Anechoic chambers</strong> are known for their extreme
          quietness. Noise levels inside can be as low as
          <span class="bold">10-20 dBA</span>. For example, in 2005, the
          quietest chamber was recorded at <span class="bold">-9.4 dBA</span>,
          and in 2015, a chamber at <em>Microsoft</em> set the world record at
          <span class="bold">-20.6 dBA</span>.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          Note: Some people find the absolute silence disorienting, as it is an
          unnatural experience for the human ear.
        </div>
        <h2>Reflection Reduction Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Anechoic chambers</strong> use
          <span class="bold">wedge-shaped absorbers</span> to effectively reduce
          the reflection of sound waves. These absorbers are typically made of
          materials such as foam that are strategically placed to interact with
          sound waves, dissipating them rather than reflecting them back.
        </p>
        <h2>Detailed Process of Reflection Reduction</h2>
        <ul class="reflection-reduc">
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Incident Wave (I)</span> The sound wave entering
            the chamber is called the incident wave. This wave travels through
            the air toward the chamber's surfaces.
            <code>I --> Incident Sound Wave</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Impact on the Absorber (W)</span> When the
            incident wave hits the
            <span class="bold">wedge-shaped absorber (W)</span>, it is not
            merely reflected. The absorber material is designed to dissipate the
            acoustic energy of the wave by absorbing it, rather than bouncing it
            directly back.
            <code>W --> Wedge Absorber</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Partial Reflection (R)</span> Although the
            incident wave is mostly absorbed, a small portion of it may be
            reflected due to the structure of the absorber. This creates a
            <span class="bold">reflected wave (R)</span>. However, the amount of
            reflected energy is significantly reduced by the absorber's
            material.
            <code>R --> Reflected Sound Wave</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Energy Dissipation in Air (A)</span> The
            <span class="bold">reflected wave (R)</span> propagates through the
            air gap between the
            <span class="bold">wedge-shaped absorbers (A)</span>. The energy of
            the reflected wave is gradually dissipated due to interactions with
            the air and the absorbing materials (especially through the
            viscosity of the air). This process further reduces the amount of
            reflected wave that could return to the sound source.
            <code>A --> Air Gap</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Dissipation via the Corners (C)</span> The
            corners of the absorber are specifically designed to maximize energy
            dissipation. As the sound wave bounces in the
            <span class="bold">air gap (A)</span>, it is quickly converted into
            heat due to interactions with the absorbing materials. This prevents
            the reflected wave from being sent back into the chamber, minimizing
            undesirable reflections.
            <code>C --> Corner </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Thus, the
          <span class="bold">reflection reduction mechanism</span> relies on a
          series of interactions between the sound waves and the
          <span class="bold">wedge-shaped absorbers</span>. These interactions
          efficiently dissipate the wave's energy, preventing it from reflecting
          back to the sound source and allowing for a pure, measurable acoustic
          environment.

        <h2>Difference from Full Anechoic Chambers</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike full <strong>anechoic chambers</strong>,
          <strong>semi-anechoic</strong> and <strong>hemi-anechoic</strong>
          chambers do not absorb energy in all directions. These chambers
          typically feature a solid floor to support heavier objects such as
          vehicles or industrial machinery, making them suitable for tests that
          require a solid surface.

        <h2>Purpose of RF Anechoic Chambers</h2>
        <img

        <p>
          <strong>RF anechoic chambers</strong> are specifically designed for
          testing <span class="bold">antennas</span>,
          <span class="bold">radars</span>, and
          <span class="bold">electromagnetic interference (EMI)</span>. The
          internal surfaces are lined with
          <span class="bold">radiation absorbent materials (RAM)</span>
          to absorb RF radiation and minimize reflections.
        </p>
        <h2>Radiation Absorbent Material (RAM)</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">RAM</span> is a specialized material that absorbs
          electromagnetic radiation (non-ionizing radiation) to reduce the level
          of reflected RF radiation. The effectiveness of
          <span class="bold">RAM</span> is crucial for accurate measurement in
          fields like antenna testing.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance and Chamber Size</h2>
        <p>
          The chamber's ability to absorb radiation depends on its size and the
          frequency range being tested. Larger chambers are used for lower
          frequencies (longer wavelengths), while smaller chambers are
          sufficient for higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths).
          <code>λ = v / f (wavelengths = velocity / frequency)</code>
        </p>
        <h2>Installation and Security</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>RF anechoic chambers</strong> are often built inside shielded
          rooms that use the Faraday cage<sup id="ref-3"

        <h2>Risks Associated with RF Anechoic Chambers</h2>
        <p>
          Several risks are associated with RF anechoic chambers, especially
          during high-frequency tests.
        </p>
        <ul class="risks-list">
          <li>
            <span class="bold">RF Radiation:</span> Personnel are typically not
            allowed inside the chamber during testing, as RF radiation (though
            non-ionizing) can pose health risks, especially at high power
            levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Fire Hazard:</span> The RAM absorbs RF radiation
            and may generate heat. Without proper heat dissipation, this could
            lead to fire risks, especially if high-power antennas are too close
            to the RAM.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Trapped Personnel:</span> Safety measures should
            be in place to prevent personnel from being trapped inside the
            chamber in the event of an emergency.
