# fcc-TechnicalDocumentationPage

## 📋 Overview

This project is a **Technical Documentation Page** inspired by the certification project from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It provides detailed information about **Anechoic Chambers**, their types, uses, and applications in both acoustic and radio frequency contexts.

## 🎯 Purpose

The aim was to build a responsive, well-structured documentation page while fulfilling all the required technical specifications. The page explains the concept of anechoic chambers, their types (acoustic, semi-anechoic, and RF), their uses, and safety considerations.

## 🛠️ Project Context

The task was to build a **Technical Documentation Page** with a focus on **Anechoic Chambers**.

The goal was to practice :

- **Semantic HTML:** Using the correct structure for sections, headers, and navigation.
- **CSS Responsiveness:** Ensuring the design works on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Navigation:** Creating a clear and functional navigation system for easier access to different sections.
